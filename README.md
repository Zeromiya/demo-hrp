# Hospital Reservation System
This was part of a group project its uncomplete and basically far from anything that resembles a functioning system. However feel free to check out the database connections and etc. There are some wrong examples of coding and a lot of repetition yet you can easily refactor the code to a proper level and use it for your own projects if you are willing to.
